Welcome to the **UniversityStuff** repository! This is where I store all the code and projects I've worked on during my university coding classes. Here, you'll find a collection of assignments, projects, and coding exercises that reflect my journey through various courses.

## Description

In this repository, I've organized my university coding class materials to help me keep track of what I've learned and accomplished. Each folder corresponds to a specific course or topic, containing code snippets, assignments, and possibly some small projects.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
UniversityStuff/
│
├── Course1/
│   ├── Assignments/
│   ├── Projects/
│   └── README.md
│
├── Course2/
│   ├── Assignments/
│   ├── Projects/
│   └── README.md
│
└── ...
```

- Each `CourseX` directory contains materials from a specific course.
- The `Assignments` folder within each course directory holds the assignments I've completed.
- The `Projects` folder contains any larger projects or personal explorations related to the course.
- A `README.md` file within each course directory may provide more information about the course and its contents.

## Usage

Feel free to explore this repository if you're curious about my progress through university coding classes. You can browse the folders, review code snippets, and even reuse any code that might be helpful for your own learning. However, please keep in mind that the solutions here are meant to serve as references and learning aids, rather than direct solutions for your own assignments.

## Contributing

I'm not currently accepting contributions to this repository, as it's primarily a personal collection of my learning journey. However, if you'd like to provide feedback or suggestions, feel free to contact me using the information in my profile.
